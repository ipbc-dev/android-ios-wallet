1.      Use of Cake Wallet
The Cake Wallet app (hereinafter, referred to as the "App") allows the use of accessing the Monero Blockchain/network. You are not authorized, and nor should you rely on the App for legal advice, business advice, or advice of any kind. You act at your own risk in reliance on the contents of the App. Should you make a decision to act or not act you should contact a licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdiction in which you want or need help. In no way are the owners of, or contributors to, the App responsible for the actions, decisions, or other behavior taken or not taken by you in reliance upon the App.

If you notice any inconsistency, please report them on GitHub.
3.      Risks related to the use of Cake Wallet.
The App, the App’s owner Cake Technologies LLC and Cake Technologies owners, partners, employees, contributors, and any affiliates will not be responsible for any losses, damages or claims arising from events falling within the scope of the following five categories:
1.      (1) Mistakes made by the user of any Monero-related software or service, e.g., forgotten passwords, payments sent to wrong Monero addresses, and accidental deletion of wallets.
2.      (2) Software problems of the App and/or any Monero-related software or service, e.g., corrupted wallet file, incorrectly constructed transactions, unsafe cryptographic libraries, malware affecting the App and/or any Monero-related software or service.
3.      (3) Technical failures in the hardware of the user of any Monero-related software or service, e.g., data loss due to a faulty or damaged storage device.
4.      (4) Security problems experienced by the user of any Monero-related software or service, e.g., unauthorized access to users' wallets and/or accounts.

4.      Investment risks
The investment in Monero can lead to loss of money over short or even long periods. The investors in Monero should expect prices to have large range fluctuations. 
5.      Compliance with tax obligations
